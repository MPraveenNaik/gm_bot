# Automated Reply Bot
1.
This project is an automated bot that replies to messages with specific keywords ("good morning", "gm", "g m") using a random greeting and an image file. It fetches user profile and message feed data, and requires authentication using a bearer token.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PythonAnywhere account (or any other hosting environment)
- Required Python packages (`requests`, `python-dotenv`, `logging`)
2.Installing dependencies:

Use the following command to install the required Python packages:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Ensure the Bearer Token is up-to-date:

The bot uses the bearer token from the .env file. Make sure the BEARER_TOKEN is valid and not expired.
If the bearer token is not available or has expired, the script will attempt to fetch a new token using the provided AUTH_URL, USERNAME, PASSWORD, and CLIENT_ID.
Update the .env file with the new token whenever it changes.
4.Images Required for Responses:

The bot randomly selects one of the images to send as a response. The available image files should be placed in the project directory.

Supported image formats: .jpeg, .jpg, .gif
The following files are included by default:
gm1.jpeg

200w.gif

Note: You can add more image files to the list. Make sure they are in the same directory as the script or provide the relative path.
5.run script 
 python gmbot.py
